Built a VS code [extension](https://github.com/mtrazzi/grant-application-simulator) as part of a weekend [hackathon](https://www.apartresearch.com/event/research-augmentation-hackathon-supercharging-ai-alignment) (got second place).

Before that I was [meditating](https://x.com/MichaelTrazzi/status/1807774964487180304), and doing paper [walkthroughs](https://theinsideview.ai/walkthroughs).
