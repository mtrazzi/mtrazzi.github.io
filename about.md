I run <a href="https://theinsideview.ai">The Inside View</a>, a Youtube channel and podcast where I talk about AI progress. I have previously worked with <a href="https://www.credit-agricole.com/en/">the number one french bank</a> (working on a computer vision feature), <a href="https://hash.ai/">hash.ai</a> (working directly with the CEO on scaling), <a href='https://azmed.co/'>azmed.co</a> (detecting bone fractures in X-rays with computer vision), <a href="https://www.ledr.io">ledr.io</a> (building a Python/C API), <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/">FloydHub</a> (wrote deep reinforcement learning blogs) and the <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a> (interned in AI Safety there). You can find some of my writing on <a href='https://blog.floydhub.com/author/michaeltrazzi/'>FloydHub</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@MichaelTrazzi">Medium</a>, the <a href='https://www.alignmentforum.org/users/mtrazzi'>Alignment Forum</a> and <a href='https://www.twitter.com/MichaelTrazzi'>Twitter</a>. I also sometimes <a href='https://soundcloud.com/sendmetrance'>mix and produce music</a>.

As of now, I am currently recording a documentary about SB-1047 in the San Francisco bay area. If you'd like to be interviewed (in person or remotely) you can drop me a DM on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelTrazzi) or [email](michael@theinsideview.ai) me.
